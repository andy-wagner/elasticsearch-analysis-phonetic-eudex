# Eudex phonetic plugin for Elasticsearch

Eudex is a Soundex-esque phonetic reduction/hashing algorithm, providing locality sensitive "hashes" of words, based on the spelling and pronunciation.

This is a Java port of [Eudex](https://github.com/ticki/eudex), which is implemented in Rust.

# Example

In the mapping, use an analyzer or token filter of type "eudex"::

    {
        "index":{
            "analysis":{
                "analyzer":{
                    "my_phonetic":{
                        "type":"eudex"
                    }
                },
                "filter":{
                    "my_phonetic":{
                        "type":"eudex"
                    }
                },
                "tokenizer":{
                    "my_phonetic":{
                        "type": "standard",
                        "filter":[ "my_phonetic" ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
